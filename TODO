UPDATE:

READ:
- Remove HasRead and LastReadChapter from Library Database.

- Add any Books the User Opens to the History Library ( This Will include Books that are NOT downloaded ), Keeps a consistent History log.
- Update History Library to Sort the Books by Order of Last Read.
- Update Downloaded Library to Sort the Books in Reverse Order. ( Since the Order they are added to DB is the Order that they were Downloaded and Newer Downloads should show before old ones ).

- Add UnreadDownload as a boolean to the Book and DB.
